# Lesson_131_homework

This is my homework of second course 

Here, I created small Flask website, that imitates Instagram

## Here only 5 pages:
#### 1)Main page
#### 2)Search page
#### 3)Profile page
#### 4)Bookmarks page
#### 5)Tags page

Nevertheless, this project has several minor issues:
1) Some links don't work propely
2) Website needs active items, for example React-items, Java-scripts
